## Explaination
I use  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for project initiation.

### Libraries in this project
* react-router-dom for routing
* styled-components for styling, theming
* react-testing-library, jest-dom for unit testing
* lodash/debounce to make sure call update after user done typing

#### Run test by `yarn test`
